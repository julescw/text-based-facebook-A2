This is a Text-based Facebook coding assignment from the course SYSC2006 - Foundations of Imperative Programming.

A main menu continuously prints where users can register, change their password, manage their posts (add/remove), manage their friends (add/remove) as well as display posts from friends. 

Within the assignment, we were given a CSV file to read from along with unchangeable data structures and preset function headers. I have added several functions to improve the program's functionality, and these changes are noted in the file a2_functions.h.

After the necessary information is read from the CSV file using a function written by the course instructors, the program initializes each user. The list of users is implemented as a linked list, and their posts and friends are implemented as linked lists and stacks respectively. The users' and friends' usernames have to be linked in alphabetical order. 

This assignment helped me further familiarize myself with structures, linked lists and pointers and further advanced my understanding of general coding principles.
